# /octave-library - Library Management

Browse, search, create, and update Octave library entities.

## Trigger

User runs `/octave-library` with subcommands:
- `/octave-library list <type>` - List entities of a type

- `/octave-library show <oId>` - Show full entity details
- `/octave-library create <type> "<name>"` - Create new entity
- `/octave-library update <oId>` - Update existing entity

Or natural language like:
- "Show me all personas"
- "What playbooks do we have?"

### Subcommand: update

Update an existing entity.

**Usage:**
```
/octave-library update pe_abc123
/octave-library update pe_abc123 --instructions "Add focus on AI/ML adoption"
```

**Interactive Flow:**

1. **Fetch current entity:**
   ```
   Fetching: CTO - Enterprise Tech (pe_abc123)
   ```

   - Add "AI readiness" to pain points

   Proceed? (yes/no)
   ```

4. **Apply the update:**

   **For playbooks** (oId starts with `pb_`), use `update_playbook`:
   ```
   update_playbook({
     oId: "pb_xyz789",
     instructions: "Update the objection handling to address security concerns...",
     keyContext: "<any additional context>"

   update_entity({
     entityType: "persona",
     oId: "pe_abc123",
     instructions: "Add AI/ML adoption as a key objective...",
     keyContext: "<any additional context>"
   })
   ```

5. **Report success:**
   ```
   Updated persona: CTO - Enterprise Tech

   Changes applied:
   - Added AI/ML adoption objective
   - Updated responsibilities
   - Added AI readiness pain point

   Use /octave-library show pe_abc123 to see the updated version.
   ```

### Playbook Updates (Special Handling)

Playbooks have a nested structure requiring different tools for different parts:

**Playbook Structure:**
- **Core attributes** - Key insights, approach angle, strategic narrative, associated personas, qualifying questions
- **Value props** - Persona-specific value propositions (nested within the playbook)

**Decision Logic:**

| User Request | Tools to Use |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Update the playbook's approach angle" | `update_playbook` |
| "Change the strategic narrative" | `update_playbook` |
| "Add a qualifying question to the XYZ playbook about company size being more than 50 employees" | `update_playbook` |
| "Update the value prop for CTOs" | `update_value_props` |
| "Add a new value prop for the CFO persona" | `add_value_props` |
| "Rework the whole playbook including value props" | Both `update_playbook` and value prop tools |

**Updating Value Props Flow:**

1. **Fetch playbook with `get_playbook`** - This returns the full playbook including all value props with their oIds. If you only need the list of value props and their oIds (and not the rest of the playbook), you can instead call `list_value_props` as a lighter-weight alternative.

2. **Identify what needs to change:**
   - Core attributes (insights, narrative, approach) → use `update_playbook`
   - Existing value props → use `update_value_props`
   - New value props → use `add_value_props`

3. **Apply changes with appropriate MCP tool(s)**

**Example - Updating a Value Prop:**
```
User: "Make the CTO value prop focus more on cost savings"

1. Fetch playbook: get_playbook({ oId: "pb_xyz789" })
2. Find CTO value prop oId from response (e.g., "hy_abc123")
3. Update using update_value_props:
   - playbookOId: the playbook containing the value prop
   - updates: array of changes, each with:
     - oId: the value prop oId (hy_ prefix)
     - name: new title (optional)
     - details: new description (optional)
     - archive: true to archive (optional)
     - delete: true to delete (optional)
   - reasoning: why these changes are being made
```

**Example - Updating Qualifying Questions:**
```
User: "Change the qualifying question about budget to focus on timeline instead"

1. Fetch playbook: get_playbook({ oId: "pb_xyz789" })
2. Review current qualifying questions
3. Update: update_playbook({
     oId: "pb_xyz789",
     instructions: "Replace the qualifying question about budget with one that focuses on project timeline and urgency. Keep all other qualifying questions unchanged."
   })
```

**Example - Adding New Value Props:**
```
User: "Add value props for the CFO persona"

1. Fetch playbook to confirm CFO persona is associated
2. Use add_value_props:
   - playbookOId: the playbook to add to
   - personaOIds: array of persona oIds to generate for (optional, defaults to all)
   - numValuesPerPersona: how many to generate (default: 4)
   - instructions: guidance for generation (optional)
   - replaceExisting: true to archive existing first (default: false)
```

- `delete_resource` - Delete one or more resources
- `search_resources` - Semantic search across global resources

## Error Handling

**Entity Not Found:**
> Entity "[oId]" not found in your library.
>
> This usually means the oId is wrong or the entity was deleted.
> 1. Run `/octave-library list [type]` to see available entities and their oIds
> 2. Check for typos in the oId
> 3. Search by name instead: `/octave-library search [name]`

**Invalid Entity Type:**
> Unknown entity type "[input]".
>
> Valid types: personas, products, playbooks, segments, use-cases,
> competitors, proof-points, references, services, brand-voices, writing-styles
>
> Check spelling and try again.

**Create/Update Failed:**
> Failed to [create/update] [type]: [error message]
>
> Options:
> 1. Check that all required fields are provided
> 2. Try again with simpler instructions
> 3. Run `/octave-workspace` to verify your connection
