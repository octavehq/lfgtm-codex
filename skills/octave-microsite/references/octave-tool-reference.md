#### For All Microsites (Always Run)

Start with enrichment and qualification — this drives the personalization that makes microsites work:

|---------------|------|-------------|
| Company profile | `enrich_company({ companyDomain })` | Always — industry, size, tech stack, signals power the entire page |
| ICP fit scoring | `qualify_company({ companyDomain })` | Always — matched segment determines which playbook to pull |
| Matching playbook | `search_knowledge_base({ query: "<industry> <persona>", entityTypes: ["playbook"] })` | Always — messaging, value props, and positioning for their segment |
| Playbook + value props | `get_playbook({ oId, includeValueProps: true })` | After finding the best-fit playbook — drives the solution section |
| Brand voice | `list_all_entities(entityType: "brand_voice")` | Always — consistent tone across the microsite |
