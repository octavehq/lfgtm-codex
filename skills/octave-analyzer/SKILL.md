# /octave-analyzer - Conversation Analysis

Analyze email threads, call transcripts, and sales conversations against your Octave library. Evaluates messaging resonance, playbook adherence, and competitive differentiation. Provides actionable insights, suggested improvements, and draft follow-ups.

## Usage

```
/octave-analyzer [--type email|call|chat]
```

## Examples

```
/octave-analyzer                              # Interactive - paste content
/octave-analyzer --type email                 # Analyze email thread
/octave-analyzer --type call                  # Analyze call transcript
```

## Instructions

When the user runs `/octave-analyzer`:

### Step 1: Get Content to Analyze

```
What would you like me to analyze?

1. Paste an email thread
2. Paste a call transcript
3. Paste a chat/message thread
4. Provide a file path

(Paste content below or tell me the file path)
```

Accept pasted content or read from file. Content can be:
- Email thread (with headers or without)
- Call transcript (with speaker labels or without)
- Chat/messaging thread
- Meeting notes

### Step 2: Parse and Structure the Content

**For Email:**
Extract:
- Participants (internal vs external)
- Thread direction (outbound, inbound, back-and-forth)
- Key messages from each party
- Current status (awaiting response, ended, etc.)

**For Call Transcript:**
Extract:
- Participants and roles
- Speaker segments
- Key exchanges
- Duration indicators if available

**For Chat:**
Extract:
- Participants
- Message sequence
- Key exchanges

### Step 3: Identify Context

Use MCP tools to gather context:

**Research external participants:**
```
# Get external participant info
find_person({
  searchMode: "specific_person",
  email: "<external email>",  # or
  firstName: "<name>",
  companyName: "<company>"
})

# Get company info
find_company({
  domain: "<domain from email>"  # or inferred from signature
})

# Match to persona
qualify_person({
  person: { email: "<email>", jobTitle: "<title>" },
  additionalContext: "Identify which persona this person matches"
})
```

**Get library context:**
```
# Find relevant playbook
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<key topics from conversation>",
  entityTypes: ["playbook"]
})
```

### Step 4: Analyze Against Library

Run three analysis dimensions:

---

#### Resonance Analysis
*Did our messaging land? What signals indicate engagement or disengagement?*

Use MCP to get persona details:
```
# Search for messaging we used
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<key phrases from our messages>",
  entityTypes: ["persona", "playbook", "use_case"]
})

# Compare to persona pain points
get_entity({ oId: "<matched_persona_oId>" })
```

Evaluate:
- Pain points addressed vs. persona's documented pain points
- Value props used vs. available value props
- Questions asked vs. recommended discovery questions
- Response patterns indicating interest/skepticism

---

#### Adherence Analysis
*Did we follow the playbook? What did we miss?*

Use MCP to get playbook details:
```
# Get the relevant playbook
get_playbook({ oId: "<matched_playbook_oId>", includeValueProps: true })
```

Compare conversation to playbook:
- Strategic narrative alignment
- Value props delivered vs. available
- Qualifying questions asked
- Objection handling approach
- Discovery depth

---

#### Differentiation Analysis
*Did we position against competitors effectively?*

Use MCP to get competitor details:
```
# Check for competitor mentions
search_knowledge_base({
  query: "<competitor names or hints from conversation>",
  entityTypes: ["competitor"]
})

# Get competitor details
get_entity({ oId: "<competitor_oId>" })
```

Evaluate:
- Competitor mentions (explicit or implicit)
- Our differentiation points used vs. available
- Landmines set or missed
- Competitive traps addressed

### Step 5: Generate Analysis Report

See [conversation-output-template.md](references/conversation-output-template.md) for the Conversation Analysis output template.

### Step 6: Offer Refinements

```
What would you like to do next?

1. Deep dive on a specific analysis area
2. Get more suggestions for [resonance / adherence / differentiation]
3. Refine the follow-up message
4. Generate content to address gaps
5. Compare to another conversation
6. Save insights to deal notes
7. Done

Your choice:

## Analysis Scoring Guide

### Resonance Score (1-10)
| Score | Meaning | Signals |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 9-10 | Strong engagement | Multiple questions, shared details, expressed urgency |
| 7-8 | Good engagement | Engaged responses, some interest signals |
| 5-6 | Neutral | Polite but non-committal |
| 3-4 | Weak | Short responses, delayed replies |
| 1-2 | Disengaged | Objections, pushback, ghosting |

### Adherence Score (1-10)
| Score | Meaning | Signals |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 9-10 | Full adherence | All playbook elements used appropriately |
| 7-8 | Good adherence | Most elements used, minor gaps |
| 5-6 | Partial adherence | Some elements used, key gaps |
| 3-4 | Weak adherence | Few elements used, off-playbook |
| 1-2 | Non-adherent | Didn't follow playbook approach |

### Differentiation Score (1-10)
| Score | Meaning | Signals |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 9-10 | Strong positioning | Clear differentiation, competitive landmines set |
| 7-8 | Good positioning | Some differentiation, mostly positioned |
| 5-6 | Neutral | Didn't address competition directly |
| 3-4 | Weak positioning | Competitor strengths uncountered |
| 1-2 | Poor positioning | Lost competitive ground |
